# bootstrap

## Description

Program for fast bootstrapping of my personal development environment on new computers (e.g in the Cloud). The program does the following:

1. Checks the architecture of the new computer (macOS-arm64 and Linux-amd64 are supported)
1. Checks if the dependencies bzip2 and unzip are in PATH
1. Creates useful directories (e.g. $HOME/Projects)
1. Installs the *latest* versions of my essential programs. For those that do not offer prebuilt binaries, I use binaries compiled by me and hosted on my public Google Drive
1. Pulls my configuration files from my public Google Drive
1. Connects to your **private** Google Drive
1. Pulls your keys from your **private** Google Drive (under 'Keys' folder)
1. Connects to your [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) account

> In previous versions, the program did bidirectional syncing (similar to how Android backups certain settings on Google Drive). This was done with rclone's bisync. Unfortunately, bisync is experimental, and there was a plethora of problems. Hence, bidirectional syncing was removed ðŸ˜¢.

## Installation

bzip2 and unzip are needed for the installation of programs.

To install, just `git clone https://github.com/gvlassis/bootstrap.git`.

To run, simply `./bootstrap/src/bootstrap.sh`

When prompted, provide your Google Drive username, rclone client ID and atuin username

## Architecture

Code is split to various files under ./src. Each of these files roughly correspond to one of the steps listed in the [Description](#description) section.

set_ids.sh assigns the locations of the programs to be installed to *_id variables.

utils.sh checks that the dependencies are in PATH.

create_dirs.sh creates useful directories.

install_programs.sh uses the *_id variables plus curl, git and [goodls](https://github.com/tanaikech/goodls) to download the *latest* versions of my essential programs.

> Shameless plug: One of the installed programs is [pokecat](https://github.com/gvlassis/pokecat). Try it!

pull_configs.sh pulls my configuration files from my public Google Drive.

connect_drive.sh connects (via [rclone](https://rclone.org/)) to your **private** Google Drive. Your client_secret and config_token are needed to log in.

pull_keys.sh pulls your keys from your **private** Google Drive.

connect_atuin.sh, well, connects to [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) ðŸ˜‚.
